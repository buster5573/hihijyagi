        <h1>Why this goal?</h1>
        <p>We are all born with certain purposes of life that contribute to humanity in a long term. Some live for entertainment, some live for experience, and some live for knowledge. Speculating about how I lived my life for 27 years, I believe in myself that I always wanted to live my life to embrace knowledge.</p>
        <p>The reason I want to pursue programming and data analytics is because:<br>
            (A)I love the idea that everyone is treated equal&fair in the world of internet<br>
            (B)The main requirement of this industry is "constant learning" which aligns very well with my attitude towards life<br>
            (C)This industry is meant to design the future of humanity.</p>
        <p>With the immense support from my beloved husband, Edward, I just initiated the momentum to pursue what I want in my life. I want to take the moment to thank my husband and his great energy in motivating me, even when I was displeased of some failures and uncertain about my future. Because of him, I was able to grasp a hint what I really wanted to invest my energy. As a return, I want to <b>pamper him back</b> with so much affection, and financial support once I become successful and attain the amount of wealth that I always dreamed of.</p>
