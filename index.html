<h1>Hello My <strong>Jyagi</strong></h1>
<u>I woke up at 8am today!!!</u><br><br>
So I am little bit sleepy now<br>
But I am cute!!!<br>
I had a cup of Starbucks <strong>Almond Milk Flat White</strong>.
<p><strong>Almond Milk Flat White?!</strong>Yes! Almond Milk Flat White. I needed a great prize for me to wake up at 8am and start my day with a <u>self-taught HTML crash course.</u></p><p style="margin-top:30px;">
<p>People say HTML is the easiest and most basic programming language to learn. It only contains 150 grammars - stuffs like < u>< br> - and takes about 10 minutes to master this. 
    My goal is to master some programming languages including <u>Python, SQL, R</u> as well as <u>Statistics</u> and become a <strong>data analyst!!!</strong>
    Why data analyst??? Because I like analyzing things. It is such a booming occupation that is also well-paid...
